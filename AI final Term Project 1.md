**AI final Term Project:**  Speech Emotion Recognition

**Speech Emotion Recognition:**

The realm of Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is dynamically evolving within the field of

affective computing, aiming to comprehend and interpret human emotions conveyed through

speech signals. This paper conducts a thorough exploration of cutting-edge techniques and

methodologies utilized in SER, underscoring the importance of precise emotion classification for

diverse applications, including human-computer interfaces, virtual assistants, and mental health

monitoring systems. We delve into the challenges inherent in extracting emotional cues from

speech signals, encompassing factors such as variability in emotional expression, cultural

distinctions, and the influence of environmental conditions. Furthermore, we scrutinize recent

breakthroughs in machine learning and signal processing approaches, encompassing deep

learning architectures and feature extraction methods, which have notably elevated the

performance of SER systems. The paper culminates in a discussion regarding prevailing

constraints, potential future avenues, and the broader implications of advancing SER technology

in augmenting the empathetic capabilities of artificial intelligence systems.

**End-to-End Speech Emotion Recognition:**

GitHub repository contains code to build a Machine Learning model which can predict the

probability of emotion of a user among different emotions using features of an audio.

**Algorithms:**

**Why Keras Deep Learning:**

Keras is a popular high-level deep learning library that is widely used in the machine learning

community. Keras offers a straightforward and user-friendly interface, enabling developers to

rapidly create prototypes and conduct experiments in the realm of deep learning models. With its

modular structure, Keras simplifies the process of constructing and adjusting neural networks,

eliminating the need for an in-depth understanding of the intricate mathematical intricacies that

underlie these models.

**Tensorflow Usage:**

TensorFlow is a popular open-source machine learning framework and provides a versatile

platform that supports various machine learning tasks, including but not limited to deep learning,

machine learning, and numerical computations. This flexibility makes it suitable for a broad

range of applications.

**Instructions to run code:**

· Open the Speech\_Emotion\_Recognitioin.ipynb file in googlecolab, as we have taken

huge dataset and it cannot be processed in local jupyter notebook. We are using

googlecolab , so that we can easily access dataset in the googlecolab.

· Upload the dataset in the google drive, so that we can easily access them by connecting

google drive.

· Once above all the steps are performed, execute all the cells in the

Speech\_Emotion\_Recognition.ipynb. We will get the required model predictions at the

end with the prediction probabilities

**Evaluation metrics:**

The evaluation is a file with prediction probabilities and find the emotion.
